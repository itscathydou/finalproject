                <h1>BEGINNER TIPS</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>1. GET BASIC COMPOSITION DOWN</h3>
                        <p>The heart of a photograph is its composition—the position of different elements in a frame. The easiest rule of thumb to learn and remember is the Rule of Thirds. Basically, you'll want to break your frame into nine squares of roughly equal size. Try and align the subject of your photo along these lines and intersections and imagine the main image divided over these nine boxes. This gives you a more dramatic, visually interesting shot than one where you subject is located dead center. Many cameras have a rule of thirds grid overlay that you can activate when shooting.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>2. ADJUST EXPOSURE COMPENSATION</h3>
                        <p>As long as you aren't shooting in full manual mode, your digital camera is making decisions that determine the exposure of a photo—in English, how light or dark the shot appears. Generally speaking, a camera looks at a scene and tries to determine the appropriate exposure based on the correct lighting of a gray card, which is why there are special scene modes for snow—without them, the camera would try to make the white snow gray.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            If a photo is too light or dark you can either delve through the dozens of scene modes that are available in modern point-and-shoot cameras, or simply dial in a bit of exposure compensation. Many cameras have a physical button or dial for this, identified by a +/- symbol. If your photo is too dark, move the scale up above zero; if too light, move it down a bit.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>3. THINK ABOUT LIGHTING</h3>
                        <p>Pay attention to how much light you have and where it's coming from when taking your photos. If you're shooting outdoors, be careful not to take photos of a person when the sun is at their back. If you're grabbing a photo in front of a monument or landmark and don't have the flexibility to adjust your position you can use the camera's flash to fill in shadows. You may have to manually activate the flash, as there's a good chance that the camera will think that it's unnecessary on a bright day.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>4. WATCH YOUR WHITE BALANCE</h3>
                        <p>Your camera will try and set white balance automatically based on the type of light in which you're shooting. Different light casts different types of color—sunlight is very blue, tungsten lighting is yellow, and fluorescent is a bit green. In many cases, the camera will automatically detect what type of lighting you're under and adjust the color in photos so that they look natural. But when White Balance isn't right, you can get results like you see above—the image on the left is correctly balanced, and the one on the right is way off. If you're shooting under mixed lighting, or if the camera is just having a hard time figuring things out, you can set the white balance manually. On most point and shoots you'll have to dive into the shooting menu to adjust this, but many DSLRs have a dedicated White Balance button, often labeled "WB." You can correct color in the included Mac or Windows photo editing apps later on, but you'll get better-looking photos if you get the white balance right in the first place.
