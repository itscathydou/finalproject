                                <h3>DJI PHANTOM 4</h3>
                                <h4>MULTIPLE FLIGHT MODES</h4>
                                <p>The Phantom 4 is flexible enough to meet different flying demands. In Position Mode you can use satellite and Vision Positioning, TapFly, ActiveTrack and Intelligent Flight Modes. Sport Mode adds extra agility and speed, reaching 45mph (72kph) while maintaining satellite and Vision Positioning systems. Atti Mode holds the Phantom’s altitude and level but switches off satellite positioning making it ideal for smooth film making movements.</p>
                                <h4>Camera with 1-inch 20MP Sensor</h4>
                                <p>The onboard camera has been redesigned to use a 1-inch 20-megapixel CMOS sensor. A custom engineered lens made up of eight elements is arranged in seven groups, it is the first DJI camera to use a mechanical shutter, eliminating rolling shutter distortion which can occur when taking images of fast moving subjects or when flying at high speed. In effect, it is as powerful as many traditional ground cameras. More powerful video processing supports H.264 4K videos at 60fps or H.265 4K at 30fps, both with a 100Mbps bitrate. Advanced sensors and processors ensure everything is captured with more image detail and the image data needed for advanced post-production.</p>
                                <h4>5-DIRECTION OF OBSTACLE SENSING</h4>
                                <p>FlightAutonomy is expanded with an additional set of high-resolution stereo vision sensors placed at the rear in addition to the pair placed at the front as well as infrared sensing systems placed on the left and right sides. This network creates a total of 5-direction of obstacle sensing and 4-direction of obstacle avoidance, protecting the Phantom 4 Pro from more obstacles and giving filmmakers the confidence to capture more complex images.</p>
                                <h4>FLY FAR FOR LONGER</h4>
                                <p>High efficiency motors and a custom designed large capacity battery offers 5,350 mAh of power, giving the Phantom 4 a 28* minute flying time. Integrated power management, balanced charging capabilities plus smart charge and discharge protection keep the battery easy to charge and ready to fly at maximum capacity.  Integrated Lightbridge technology allows you to see what the Phantom sees in 720p HD at up to 3.1mi (5km)** away.</p>

                                <h3>DJI MAVIC PRO</h3>
                                <h4>4K ULTRA HD VIDEO</h4>
                                <p>Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) is a shake reduction technology based on image cropping. It is particularly popular among compact and small drones since they can be made more simply by replacing a 3-axis gimbal stabilized camera with a fixed camera and EIS. EIS works by cropping edges from a 4K image, and can theoretically create a smooth full HD 1080p video from an original 4K video. However, EIS is unable to completely eliminate shaking and introduces ripples in both photos and videos.</p>
                                <p>To provide true 4K aerial video and a smooth live feed, the Mavic Pro is equipped with the smallest high-precision 3-axis gimbal that DJI has ever made. With brushless motors on all three axes, the gimbal can control the camera with precision, adjusting it to eliminate shake caused by movement from the Mavic. This 4K camera uses core technologies found in all DJI cameras. It is equipped with a 1/2.3 inch CMOS image sensor, commonly found in professional sports cameras, and an aerial imaging optimized integrated lens with an equivalent focal length of 28mm. It shoots smooth 4K video at 30fps, 1080P video at 96fps and 12-megapixel photos.</p>
                                <h4>TWO SETS OF SENSORS. TWICE AS RELIABLE</h4>
                                <p>Flight Control systems are critical to stable flight and they need data from different sensors on the Mavic to function. The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and the compass are the most important ones, yet they are also the most vulnerable to interference. The IMU acquires the angle, speed, and acceleration of the Mavic, so if it functions abnormally, it could negatively affect flight. The compass is used to know where the drone is heading, ensuring it flies in the right direction, and allowing it to return to home automatically. Without the compass, the Mavic would lose its ability to navigate. This is why the Mavic has dual IMUs and dual compasses.
                                <br>
                                Stability is key to safe flight:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Stability of the propulsion system: The Mavic will only fly when its motors and propellers are normal and intact, and the battery is sufficiently charged.</li>
                                    <li>Stability of flight attitude: Flight attitude is controlled by the Flight Controller. Any errors in attitude could have serious consequences including crashes.</li>
                                    <li>Stability of sensors: Flight attitude is calculated from the data of an array of sensors. Any errors from the sensors could have serious consequences including crashes.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Through DJI’s years of experience in drone development, and from extensive reliability tests DJI has found that propulsion systems and batteries are highly reliable while sensors, especially the IMU and the compass, are more slightly more susceptible to errors. This is why the Mavic has made these sensors redundant with two sets of sensors working simultaneously. Whenever the system detects an inconsistency in one, it switches to the other, keeping your flight steady and reliable.</p>
                                <h4>SAFER, SMARTER BATTERIES</h4>
                                <p>Electric vehicles use Battery Management Systems (BMS) to ensure battery performance, and LiPo batteries used in drones need BMS to function at their best. Most drones on the market today do not use intelligent batteries. Instead, they calculate battery level and even battery status, through monitoring current and voltage. The problem is that the remaining power in a LiPo battery is also reliant on battery temperature — the number of times the battery has been charged and discharged — so it cannot be accurately gauged with just current and voltage data.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                DJI first began using Intelligent Flight Batteries in the Phantom 2. BMS was applied to LiPo batteries to accurately calculate battery level, working status and also to send battery status information to the Flight Controller. The DJI Intelligent Flight Battery in the Mavic adopts the latest technologies to ensure that the flight control system is able to obtain accurate battery level. This allows it to calculate remaining flight times more accurately. It also gives pilots a full understanding of the overall battery status, including real-time battery cell status, circle number, temperature and more, and all in the DJI GO 4 app. As well as monitoring the battery status during flight, the BMS also has overcharge and over discharge protection, reducing the likelihood of battery damage. When not in use for extended periods of time, DJI Intelligent Flight Battery automatically discharges to 50% charge, keeping it at an optimum charge level for extended battery life. When flying in cold temperatures, the BMS will activate low-temperature protection and will control power output according to the temperature. This ensures the battery can provide adequate propulsion without damage from the cold.
                                </p>
                                <h4>FINELY TUNED CONTROL</h4>
                                <p>Tripod Mode drops the Mavic’s maximum speed to just 2.2mph (3.6kph), and the control stick sensitivity of the remote controller is dulled to give you the precision you need for accurate framing. It is also great for flying indoors in small spaces where the Mavic’s normal speed may make it more challenging to fly.</p>
