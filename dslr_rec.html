                                <p>Take your photography to the next level with this powerful DSLR.
                                    <br>
                                    Take your photography to new heights with a 24.2 MP sensor, customisable 19 point AF system and versatile controls.
                                </p>
                                <h4>CUSTOMISABLE 19-POINT AUTOFOCUS</h4>
                                <p>The EOS 760D’s customisable 19-point autofocus system locks onto your subject when shooting sports, portraits or landscapes. Each focus point is a 'cross-type' meaning it can lock on to your subject quickly and accurately so you can achieve superb results whether you’re shooting sports, portraits or landscapes.</p>
                                <h4>FAST PROCESSOR FOR ACTION</h4>
                                <p>The fast DIGIC 6 processor means you can shoot at up to 5fps and never miss a decisive moment. A 7560 pixel metering sensor gives consistent and accurate exposures and Flicker Detection.</p>
                                <h4>FLICKER DETECTION</h4>
                                <p>Flickering light, such as that produced by fluorescent light bulbs, can cause inconsistent brightness and colour while shooting. The EOS 760D can detect such conditions and time each shot to coincide with the peak brightness of the flickering light source, for consistent results.</p>
                                <h4>CAPTURE INCREDIBLE DETAIL</h4>
                                <p>The 24.2MP sensor captures incredible detail so you can crop and enlarge images for printing, while the fast DIGIC 6 processor means you’ll never miss a decisive moment.</p>
                                <h4>SMOOTHER RESULTS</h4>
                                <p>Shoot stunning Full HD movies with cinematic depth of field using the EOS 760D’s Hybrid CMOS AF III autofocus technology. It enables smooth focusing and subject tracking so your subject will look sharp and in focus while the background remains beautifully blurred. MP4 support allows easy upload and transfer of your movies.</p>

                                <h3>NIKON D810</h3>
                                <h4>CINEMA READY</h4>
                                <p>Record Full HD (1080p) movies at 50p/60p. Access the full light sensitivity range, from ISO 64, while filming, and control shutter speed, aperture, and audio levels, too.</p>
                                <h4>FLAGSHIP AF PERFORMANCE</h4>
                                <p>Boasting the same AF system as Nikon’s D4S, the D810 delivers the ultimate in high-resolution precision. Offers fast acquisition and improved background isolation even in challenging lighting conditions with the new Group Area AF mode.</p>
                                <h4>SHARP AND STEADY:</h4>
                                <p>The D810’s shutter/mirror box architecture and electronic front-curtain feature ensure the sharpest possible results. The shutter/mirror mechanism reduces image shake for a steady viewfinder image with minimal blackout during high-speed shooting. When activated, the electronic front-curtain shutter reduces the risk of micro-blur in even subtle details by minimising internal vibrations during exposure.</p>
                                <h4>PICTURE CONTROL EVOLVES</h4>
                                <p>Take complete control over sharpening, contrast, brightness, hue, and saturation when shooting stills and video. Shoot with the Flat setting for the ultimate freedom in post-production: retain all the details and preserve rich tonal information in both highlights and shadows. Use the Clarity setting to precisely adjust contrast and differentiate fine structures.</p>
                                <h4>COLOUR-TUNE MONITOR</h4>
                                <p>The anti-reflective 8.0-cm (3.2-in.), 1229k-dot RGBW LCD monitor allows you to push the colour balance and brightness in any direction to suit your personal workflow preference.</p>
                                <h4>MULTI-CAM 3500FX 51-POINT AF SYSTEM</h4>
                                <p>Fine-tuned for ultra-high resolution images. Configurable in 9-point, 21-point, and 51-point coverage settings and sensitive down to -2 EV (ISO 100, 20 °C/68 °F). Advancements include improved lock-on, expanded ‘store by orientation,’ and options for AF mode restrictions. Fifteen cross-type sensors in the centre are compatible with AF NIKKOR lenses with open aperture of f/5.6 or faster, and 11 central focus points work with an open aperture of f/8.</p>

                                <h3>NIKON D500</h3>
                                <p>As the smaller sibling to the D5, Nikon’s FX-format flagship, the D500 offers phenomenal power and precision. Nikon’s next-generation 153-point AF system provides exceptionally wide coverage. New image and metering sensors deliver phenomenally accurate subject recognition and detail. You can shoot at up to 10 fps, and the high-performance buffer allows up to 200 NEF (RAW) images to be captured during one high-speed burst. Combined, this means you can shoot at maximum image quality for an incredible 20 seconds. And for moviemakers who go to extremes, D-Movie enables high-definition 4K/UHD movies of up to 29 minutes and 59 seconds long to be recorded in-camera.</p>
                                <h4>FLAGSHIP AF PERFORMANCE: EXTREME PRECISION</h4>
                                <p>Equipped with the same AF system as the D5, Nikon’s FX-format flagship, the D500 lets you focus with absolute precision, even in near darkness. With an incredible 153 focus points and 99 cross-type sensors, this phenomenal AF system offers unprecedented coverage, covering almost the full width of the viewfinder frame. AF sensitivity down to -4 EV at the central point, and -3 EV (ISO 100, 20 °C/68 °F) for all other points, enables superior low-light performance. Small subjects moving at high speed can be tracked with a new level of precision and subjects at the edge of the frame are easily detected. The system is configurable for 153-point, 72-point and 25-point coverage settings in Continuous AF mode. All 153 focus points are compatible with AF NIKKOR lenses with an open aperture of f/5.6 or faster, and 15 central focus points work with an effective aperture of f/8.</p>
                                <h4>GO FURTHER: IMAGE-DEFINING SPEED</h4>
                                <p>The D500’s supercharged performance easily captures decisive moments. You can shoot at up to 10 fps with AE/AF tracking, or with mirror up. AF tracking and viewfinder visibility are vastly improved when shooting sports, or any scene in which subjects tend to change direction suddenly. Thanks to a new AF ASIC unit, maximum computing power is allocated to AF at all times. Faster sequential shutter and mirror mechanisms significantly reduce viewfinder blackout during high-speed bursts. The camera’s high-performance buffer allows up to 200 NEF (RAW) or large JPEG images to be captured during one burst. Two card slots (one for XQD cards, and one for SD UHS II cards), easily handle the camera’s incredible shooting speeds, and ensure the buffer is instantly cleared for the next burst. The USB 3.0 port enables high-speed transfer of large amounts of data, and the camera’s built-in SnapBridge capability allows wireless image transfer. For those looking for an even faster transfer solution, the D500 is also compatible with the optional WT-7A, which enables transmission of files to an FTP server or computer at speeds of up to 866.7 Mbps.

                                <h4>NAIL THE SHOT: POWERFUL METERING AND IMAGE SENSORS</h4>
                                <p>Whether you’re capturing a cheetah on the run or the pivotal moment in the X Games, the D500 will get you the shot. And not just any shot. The 20.9 MP DX-format CMOS image sensor and 180K-pixel RGB metering sensor deliver phenomenally accurate subject recognition and image detail with rich tonal gradations. The D500 also boasts a highly responsive 8.0 cm (3.2 in.), 2359k-dot tilting LCD touchscreen monitor, which frees you to shoot from high or low angles. You can easily scroll through and select key images, and input credit, location, network, IPTC and copyright information on the spot. Shoot in Live View and you can use touch operation to set the focus point, release the shutter and acquire preset Spot White Balance data, based on the selected area within the frame. For even greater control, Picture Control 2.0 makes it easy to define parameters whether you’re shooting stills or video. Ease post-production with the Flat pre-setting for maximum dynamic range; fine-adjust detail with Clarity.
